# You don't need a highway, you need cars

People *think* they want a brand new, all-encompassing "AI System" that's going to reinvent the way they do work.

I can't blame them. I've had it for a while and it's **amazing**.

In boardrooms and strategy meetings, the hunger for a grand transformative AI system is palpable. 
 - Who can we replace?
 - What can be done automatically?
 - Where are the key efficiencies that can drive KPI numbers **THROUGH THE ROOF** and put me and my family on a yacht in the Bahamas?

Maybe it's not as inhumane, and they ask questions like:
 - Where is the next opportunity to empower our workforce?
 - What tedium can we remove from our workload?
 - How can we give our employees unlimited PTO and keep the shareholders happy?

The elephant in the room that every tech-bro is eager to announce:

**AI**

We can do all this with AI, don't you know?
*Come on down to the AI store, I'll sell you a new AI. *
It'll make all your problems go away. It'll make you beautiful. It'll make you **lots of money**.

*Everybody's* doing it... don't get left behind. C'mon kid, **don't you wanna be cool**?

There's only one way. Get that API bill **CRANKIN** and hire a hit-squad of AI enablement solutions architects to pave the way towards the next generation of *Corp-Corp*.

The job won't be done until nobody knows what they do here anymore, the customer database has been re-written to only be accessible over MCP, and all your codebases have been *slopped* beyond reprieve.

Your data may or may not be sold to the highest bidder or leveraged in some training model that leaks your passphrases due to a prompt injection, but that won't be for at least a couple of months... We're talking about **now**.


# I don't blame you
It's obvious that AI is a powerful tool. Anyone that's asked Claude a question about Roman history, or plugged some python code into Chat-Geppetto knows. Google is out - LLMs are in.

And we can't help but get more excited when we see the *investment*... ohhhh the investment, billions - no, **trillions** of dollars pouring in to make the next big model.

*But what are they investing in? *

I'll tell you, not because I'm in the know, not because I built it. No, I just have it, that fancy AI system that we all want.

I've had the feeling of a fundamentally different workflow. I've had the feeling of working with an AI that changes how I approach my daily tasks, an AI that feels like a constant, hyper-competent thought partner. And let me tell you, it's amazing.

It's a powerful tool that integrates seamlessly into my workflow, acting as an extension of my own capabilities. It's an AI that I control, that I direct.

Here's the amazing part though...
My amazing AI system isn't some bespoke, million-dollar, custom-fine-tuned-RAG-enabled-tool-calling amalgamation of the latest-greatest-valuation-inflated-est APIs all being orchestrated with the precision of a SWAT team sniper. No.

My tool doesn't require you to pay-by-the-token. It's not a custom-agentic-neural network and it doesn't need a team of MIT PhD's to operate. It provides **immediate productivity** and **minimal investment**. 

It's not **the highway**....

It's just a *good car, that I learned to drive*.
